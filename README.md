- The install script picks 10 random clips from a pool of 37 for every installation.
- The plymouth script also shuffle the 10 installed clips every boot.
- Optional systemd timer to rotate clips routine automatically every day. (Manual setup)

## Prerequisites

- `plymouth`
- `plymouth-plugin-script`

## Installation

### 1. Basic Setup
Clone and run the installer to pick 10 random clips from the pool and set them as your current boot theme:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thang1191/MikuPlymouth
cd MikuPlymouth
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
To choose certain clips, scroll down to [**Customization**](#customization)

!!WARNING!!: IF YOU ARE USING A LOWER END DEVICE, [EDIT THE SCRIPT TO PICK A LOWER NUMBER OF CLIPS TO INSTALL](#black-screen)

### 2. Daily Automation (Recommended)
Because of RAM and `initramfs` size limits, only 10 clips are active at once. Use the systemd timer to rotate them automatically:

1. **Clone and move the project to a permanent location:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thang1191/MikuPlymouth
   sudo cp -r MikuPlymouth /opt/
   ```

2. **Install the automation files:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/MikuPlymouth/miku-rotate.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo cp /opt/MikuPlymouth/miku-rotate.timer /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

3. **Activate the timer:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now miku-rotate.timer
   ```

Miku will now silently refresh her routine 1 minute after boot daily.

## Customization

### Method 1: Pool Pruning (Easiest)
If you only want certain clips to appear in the rotation:
- Go to `MikuPlymouth/miku_plymouth_clip_pool/`.
- Delete the folders or frames for clips you dislike.
- The next time the script runs (manually or via timer), it will only pick from your favorites.

### Method 2: Exact Selection
To force specific clips every time:
1. Open `install.sh`.
2. Locate the line: `selected_clips=$(echo "$available_clips" | shuf -n 10 | sort)`
3. Replace it with your specific clip IDs: `selected_clips="clip002 clip015 clip021"`
4. Run `./install.sh` manually to apply.

## NIXOS 
1. Add the flake input
```
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    mikuPlymouth = {
      url = "github:Thang1191/MikuPlymouth";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
```

2. Add the module and configure plymouth
```
modules = [
  mikuPlymouth.nixosModules.default

  {
    boot.plymouth = {
      enable = true;
      themePackages = [ pkgs.mikuPlymouth ];
      theme = "MikuPlymouth";
    };
  }
];
```
### Using all 37 clips
To use all 37 clips instead of 10, use pkgs.mikuPlymouthFull
```
boot.plymouth = {
  enable = true;
  themePackages = [ pkgs.mikuPlymouthFull ];
  theme = "MikuPlymouth";
};
```
### Customization
```
boot.plymouth = {
  enable = true;
  themePackages = [
    (pkgs.mkMikuPlymouth [ 2 5 10 15 21 ])
  ];
  theme = "MikuPlymouth";
};
```

## System Limitations & Troubleshooting

### RAM Usage
Plymouth runs in uncompressed RAM and 1080p images are heavy! 
- Using more than 10 clips may cause the boot process to freeze or show a black screen depending on your hardware.

### Black Screen
- It is possible that plymouth has crashed. The easiest fix is to modify install.sh to install less clips/
- Locate the line: `pickcount=10`
- Lower the number '10' until it's usable (4 should be enough for lower end devices)
