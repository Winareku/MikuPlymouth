# Dynamic Miku Plymouth Theme

**Artist Credit:** Original animations by [@x_cast_x](https://twitter.com/x_cast_x) on Twitter.

- The install script picks 10 random clips from a pool of 37 for every installation.
- The plymouth script also shuffle the 10 installed clips every boot.
- Optional systemd timer to rotate clips routine automatically every day. (Manual setup)

## Prerequisites

- `plymouth`
- `plymouth-plugin-script`
- `mkinitcpio` (Arch-based systems)

## Installation

### 1. Basic Setup
Clone and run the installer to pick 10 random clips from the pool and set them as your current boot theme:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thang1191/MikuPlymouth
cd MikuPlymouth
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### 2. Daily Automation (Recommended)
Because of RAM and `initramfs` size limits, only 10 clips are active at once. Use the systemd timer to rotate them automatically:

1. **Clone and move the project to a permanent location:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thang1191/MikuPlymouth
   sudo cp -r MikuPlymouth /opt/
   ```

2. **Install the automation files:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/MikuPlymouth/miku-rotate.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo cp /opt/MikuPlymouth/miku-rotate.timer /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

3. **Activate the timer:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now miku-rotate.timer
   ```

Miku will now silently refresh her routine 10 seconds after boot daily.

## Customization

### Method 1: Pool Pruning (Easiest)
If you only want certain clips to appear in the rotation:
- Go to `MikuPlymouth/miku_plymouth_clip_pool/`.
- Delete the folders or frames for clips you dislike.
- The next time the script runs (manually or via timer), it will only pick from your favorites.

### Method 2: Exact Selection
To force specific clips every time:
1. Open `install.sh`.
2. Locate the line: `selected_clips=$(echo "$available_clips" | shuf -n 10 | sort)`
3. Replace it with your specific clip IDs: `selected_clips="clip002 clip015 clip021"`
4. Run `./install.sh` manually to apply.

## System Limitations & Troubleshooting

### RAM Usage
Plymouth runs in uncompressed RAM and 1080p images are heavy! 
- **10 clips** (240 frames) use **~2GB of RAM**.(I think)
- Using more than 10 clips may cause the boot process to freeze or show a black screen depending on your hardware.

### Black Srceen
- It is possible that plymouth has crashed. The easiest fix is to modify install.sh to install less clips/
- Locate the line: `selected_clips=$(echo "$available_clips" | shuf -n 10 | sort)`
- Lower the number "10" until it's usable (4 should be enough for lower end devices)

### NVIDIA Early KMS (Mandatory for RTX/GTX Cards) (Gemini found this fix, not sure if it does anything but I'll leave it here just in case)
If you see a black screen or the animation only shows up right before the login screen, you must enable Early KMS:

1. Edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and add the drivers to the `MODULES` array:
   `MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)`
2. Ensure your GRUB command line in `/etc/default/grub` contains:
   `quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1`
3. Rebuild GRUB and Initramfs:
   ```bash
   sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   sudo mkinitcpio -P
   ```
