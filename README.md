# Dynamic Miku Plymouth Theme

**Fork Notice (security-hardened fork)**  
This is a security-hardened fork intended for Arch-based systems (notably CachyOS) using systemd-boot, mkinitcpio/UKIs and X11 (i3wm). It preserves the original animations and artist credit — only installer/service robustness and security have been improved. See [FORK_NOTES.md](FORK_NOTES.md) for the full changelog and targeted audience.

- The install script picks 10 random clips from a pool of 37 for every installation.
- The plymouth theme also shuffle the 10 installed clips every boot.
- Optional systemd timer to rotate clips automatically every day. (Manual setup)

## Prerequisites

- `plymouth`
- `plymouth-plugin-script`

## Installation

### 1. Basic Setup
Clone and run the installer to pick 10 random clips from the pool and set them as your current boot theme:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thang1191/MikuPlymouth
cd MikuPlymouth
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
To choose certain clips, scroll down to [**Customization**](#customization)

!!WARNING!!: IF YOU ARE USING A LOWER END DEVICE, [EDIT THE SCRIPT TO PICK A LOWER NUMBER OF CLIPS TO INSTALL](#black-screen)

### 2. Daily Automation (Recommended)
Because of RAM and `initramfs` size limits, only 10 clips are active at once. Use the systemd timer to automatically run the script and have all 37 clips:

1. **Clone and move the project to a permanent location:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thang1191/MikuPlymouth
   sudo cp -r MikuPlymouth /opt/
   ```

2. **Install the automation files:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/MikuPlymouth/miku-rotate.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo cp /opt/MikuPlymouth/miku-rotate.timer /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

3. **Activate the timer:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now miku-rotate.timer
   ```

The service will now automatically run install.sh every day 1 minute after boot. It will also prevent shutdown for 20 seconds when running just in case.

- **Check Timer**: `systemctl list-timers miku-rotate.timer`
- **View Logs**: `journalctl -u miku-rotate.service`

## Customization

### Method 1: Pool Pruning (Easiest)
If you only want certain clips to appear in the rotation:
- Go to `MikuPlymouth/miku_plymouth_clip_pool/`.
- Delete the folders or frames for clips you dislike.
- The next time the script runs (manually or via timer), it will only pick from your favorites.

### Method 2: Exact Selection
To force specific clips every time:
1. Open `install.sh`.
2. Locate the line: `selected_clips=$(echo "$available_clips" | shuf -n 10 | sort)`
3. Replace it with your specific clip IDs: `selected_clips="clip002 clip015 clip021"`
4. Run `./install.sh` manually to apply.

## Using all 37 clips simultaneously. (Not recommended)
If you have a beefy computer and don't mind having 900+ frames of animation being loaded to ram every boot. This also removes the need to setup systemd service.
1. Open `install.sh`.
2. Locate the line: `pickcount=10`
3. Set the number to 37
4. Run `install.sh`.

## NIXOS 
1. Add the flake input
```
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    mikuPlymouth = {
      url = "github:Thang1191/MikuPlymouth";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
```

2. Add the module and configure plymouth
```
modules = [
  mikuPlymouth.nixosModules.default

  {
    boot.plymouth = {
      enable = true;
      themePackages = [ pkgs.mikuPlymouth ];
      theme = "MikuPlymouth";
    };
  }
];
```
### Using all 37 clips
To use all 37 clips instead of 10, use pkgs.mikuPlymouthFull
```
boot.plymouth = {
  enable = true;
  themePackages = [ pkgs.mikuPlymouthFull ];
  theme = "MikuPlymouth";
};
```
### Customization
```
boot.plymouth = {
  enable = true;
  themePackages = [
    (pkgs.mkMikuPlymouth [ 2 5 10 15 21 ])
  ];
  theme = "MikuPlymouth";
};
```

## System Limitations & Troubleshooting

### RAM Usage
Plymouth runs in uncompressed RAM and 1080p images are heavy! 
- Using more than 10 clips may cause the boot process to freeze or show a black screen depending on your hardware.

### Black Screen
- It is possible that plymouth has crashed. The easiest fix is to modify `install.sh` to install less clips
- Locate the line: `pickcount=10`
- Lower the number '10' until it's usable (4 should be enough for lower end devices)
- Run `install.sh`.

### NVIDIA Early KMS (Mandatory for RTX/GTX Cards)
If you see a black screen or the animation only shows up right before the login screen, you must enable Early KMS:

The fix below **only** applies to systems that uses **mkinitcpio and GRUB**. If you use other systems, you will have to look up how to enable Early KMS yourself.

1. Edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and add the drivers to the `MODULES` array:
   `MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)`
2. Ensure your GRUB command line in `/etc/default/grub` contains:
   `quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1`
3. Rebuild GRUB and Initramfs:
   ```bash
   sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   sudo mkinitcpio -P
